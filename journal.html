<li>10.28.20-
Today I'm linking the pages on my website so that they'll actually have content. So far I've made a code sketch, person card and begun to work on my website. I'm very happy with how compsci is going and I am excited about how my website will begin to evolve.</li>

<li>11.2.20-
Today I worked more on my website and styled it. It's coming together and I'm happy with my progress! Weekly labs are super efficient and productive.</li>

<li>11.16.20-
During my lab today I pushed my changes online and started to work on a codesketch where Adia and I's faces will move around a house. </li>

<li>11.20.20-
During class today I made my first codesketch with Javascript and I am starting to understand it more. I'm going to continue working on it!</li>

<li>12.9.20-
Today I'm pushing changes online and getting everything organized before break. Adia and I are almost done with the house codesketch so that should also be up soon.
